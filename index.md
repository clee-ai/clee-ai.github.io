## &#xe618; Work Experience

<div alt="entry-title">
    <h3>Senior Robotics & AI Engineer</h3>
    <h4>Rock Robotic</h4>
    <p>Feb 2021 - Present</p>
</div>

- Architected and deployed state-of-the-art AI models for automated classification and segmentation of real-world, terabyte-scale LiDAR datasets acquired by customers.
- Engineered and maintained a full-stack robotics pipeline, from backend C++ algorithm development to creating customer-facing frontend interfaces in JavaScript/Electron.
- Drove significant performance and efficiency improvements for the core AI and SLAM algorithms, optimizing C++ and CUDA code for reduced latency and memory usage in production.
- Developed a sub-centimeter accuracy localization suite leveraging both EKF and factor-graph optimization for robust navigation in GNSS-rich (tightly-coupled IMU/GNSS) and GNSS-denied (LiDAR SLAM) environments.
- Engineered a complete training and rendering pipeline for Gaussian Splatting, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstructions of real-world scenes from vision and LiDAR data.
- Implemented a robust suite of classical computer vision solutions for data integrity, including automated multi-sensor calibration, SfM-based reconstruction pipelines, and real-time dynamic object filtering.

<div alt="entry-title">
    <h3>Undergraduate AI Researcher</h3>
    <h4>University of Texas at Dallas</h4>
    <p>Jan 2020 - May 2022</p>
</div>

- Pioneered a novel deep learning methodology for segmenting massive aerial LiDAR datasets, establishing research collaborations with both the Head of the GIS Department and external utility companies.
- Engineered and validated an end-to-end AI pipeline to automatically classify power infrastructure on industry-provided LiDAR scans, developing custom techniques to overcome terabyte-scale data and GPU memory challenges.
