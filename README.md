### Professional Experience

**Senior Computer Vision & AI Engineer** | Rock Robotic | Feb 2021 - Present
* Architected and deployed state-of-the-art AI models for automated classification and segmentation of real-world, terabyte-scale LiDAR datasets acquired by customers.
* Engineered a complete training and rendering pipeline for Gaussian Splatting, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstructions of real-world scenes from vision and LiDAR data.
* Developed a sub-centimeter accuracy, factor-graph-based localization suite for robust navigation in both GNSS-rich (tightly-coupled IMU/GNSS) and GNSS-denied (LiDAR SLAM) environments.
* Created a novel, survey-grade orthomosaic generation pipeline without traditional SfM, delivering centimeter-resolution results with increased efficiency.
* Designed and implemented robust, fully automated algorithms for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of multi-sensor systems (LiDAR, IMU, Camera), eliminating the need for manual supervision.
